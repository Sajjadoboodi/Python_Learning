    "Jupyter Notebook is an open-source application that allows you to create and share documents that contain code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It supports a variety of programming languages, including Python, R, and Julia, making it a versatile tool for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Learning with a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interactive Learning**: You can write and execute code in small sections (cells) and immediately see the output, which enhances understanding.\n",
    "- **Visualization**: It supports rich media output such as charts, graphs, and images, making it easier to interpret data.\n",
    "- **Documentation**: You can combine code with markdown text to document your thought process, making your work more organized and shareable.\n",
    "- **Debugging**: By running code in smaller sections, you can identify and fix errors more efficiently.\n",
    "- **Reproducibility**: Notebooks can be shared with others, allowing them to reproduce your results step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is an excellent tool for both beginners and experienced programmers to learn, experiment, and collaborate effectively."

    "### Complex\n",
    "A complex number consists of a real part and an imaginary part. The variable `c` is assigned the value `2 + 3j`, where `2` is the real part and `3j` is the imaginary part. The `type()` function confirms that `c` is of type `complex`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boolean\n",
    "A boolean represents one of two values: `True` or `False`. The variable `d` is assigned the value `True`. The `type()` function confirms that `d` is of type `bool`.\n",

    "A list is a collection of items that are ordered and mutable. The variable `f` is assigned the value `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which is a list containing five integers. The `type()` function confirms that `f` is of type `list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuple\n",
    "A tuple is a collection of items that are ordered and immutable. The variable `g` is assigned the value `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`, which is a tuple containing five integers. The `type()` function confirms that `g` is of type `tuple`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set\n",
    "A set is a collection of unique items that are unordered. The variable `h` is assigned the value `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`, which is a set containing five unique integers. The `type()` function confirms that `h` is of type `set`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionary\n",
    "A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. The variable `i` is assigned the value `{\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\"}`, where `\"key1\"` and `\"key2\"` are keys, and `\"value1\"` and `\"value2\"` are their corresponding values. The `type()` function confirms that `i` is of type `dict`.\n",
    "\n",
