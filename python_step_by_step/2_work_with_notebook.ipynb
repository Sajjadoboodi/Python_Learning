    "# Operator Precedence in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator precedence determines the order in which operations are performed in an expression. Python follows a specific hierarchy of operations, which ensures that expressions are evaluated correctly. When multiple operators are used in an expression, the operator with the highest precedence is evaluated first.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Precedence Table\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the precedence table for Python operators, listed from highest to lowest:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parentheses `()`**\n",
    "    - Parentheses have the highest precedence and are used to explicitly specify the order of operations.\n",
    "    - Example: `(2 + 3) * 4` evaluates to `20` because the addition inside the parentheses is performed first.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exponentiation `**`**\n",
    "    - Exponentiation has the next highest precedence.\n",
    "    - Example: `2 ** 3 ** 2` evaluates to `512` because it is evaluated as `2 ** (3 ** 2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Unary Operators `+`, `-`, `~`**\n",
    "    - Unary operators like positive (`+`), negative (`-`), and bitwise NOT (`~`) are evaluated after exponentiation.\n",
    "    - Example: `-3 ** 2` evaluates to `-9` because the exponentiation is performed first.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multiplication, Division, Modulus, Floor Division `*`, `/`, `%`, `//`**\n",
    "    - These operators have the same precedence and are evaluated from left to right.\n",
    "    - Example: `10 / 2 * 3` evaluates to `15.0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Addition and Subtraction `+`, `-`**\n",
    "    - Addition and subtraction are evaluated after multiplication, division, modulus, and floor division.\n",
    "    - Example: `10 + 2 * 3` evaluates to `16`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Bitwise Shift Operators `<<`, `>>`**\n",
    "    - Bitwise left shift (`<<`) and right shift (`>>`) are evaluated after addition and subtraction.\n",
    "    - Example: `2 << 2 + 1` evaluates to `16` because `2 << (2 + 1)` is performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Bitwise AND `&`**\n",
    "    - Bitwise AND is evaluated after bitwise shift operators.\n",
    "    - Example: `5 & 3` evaluates to `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Bitwise XOR `^`**\n",
    "    - Bitwise XOR is evaluated after bitwise AND.\n",
    "    - Example: `5 ^ 3` evaluates to `6`.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Bitwise OR `|`**\n",
    "    - Bitwise OR is evaluated after bitwise XOR.\n",
    "    - Example: `5 | 3` evaluates to `7`.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Comparison Operators `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`**\n",
    "     - Comparison operators are evaluated after bitwise OR.\n",
    "     - Example: `5 > 3 and 2 < 4` evaluates to `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Logical NOT `not`**\n",
    "     - Logical NOT has higher precedence than logical AND and OR.\n",
    "     - Example: `not True and False` evaluates to `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Logical AND `and`**\n",
    "     - Logical AND is evaluated after logical NOT.\n",
    "     - Example: `True and False` evaluates to `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Logical OR `or`**\n",
    "     - Logical OR has the lowest precedence among logical operators.\n",
    "     - Example: `True or False` evaluates to `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Assignment Operators `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc.**\n",
    "     - Assignment operators have the lowest precedence overall.\n",
    "     - Example: `x = 2 + 3 * 4` assigns `14` to `x`.\n",

    "## Associativity\n",
    "\n",
    "When operators have the same precedence, their associativity determines the order of evaluation:\n",
    "- **Left-to-Right Associativity**: Most operators (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.) are evaluated from left to right.\n",
    "  - Example: `10 - 2 + 3` evaluates to `11` because it is evaluated as `(10 - 2) + 3`.\n",
    "- **Right-to-Left Associativity**: Some operators (e.g., `**`, assignment operators) are evaluated from right to left.\n",
    "  - Example: `2 ** 3 ** 2` evaluates to `512` because it is evaluated as `2 ** (3 ** 2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parentheses**:\n",
